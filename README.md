# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-week-4-peer-review-assignment
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

•First, download and unzip the data file into your R working directory.

•Second, download the R source code into your R working directory.
•Finally, execute R source code to generate tidy data file.


# Data description

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# Code explaination

The code combined the test and training data sets, and extracted the mean and standard deviation results of each variable for each activity to generate a new dataset. 



# Creating the data set

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
